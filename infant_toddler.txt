        .


### Cognitive Domain
Infant (Birth to 24 months)  

    INDICATOR: Attention Regulation: Attention span is short but increasing. Infants focus on interesting stimuli, and by the end of this period can shift and re-engage attention with growing control (e.g., will attend to a toy, look away when bored or overstimulated, then return focus if it’s presented again) 


    INDICATOR: Problem Solving: Explores solving simple challenges through trial and error (e.g., figuring out how to get a toy that's out of reach by pulling a blanket, or pressing a button to make a sound) 
 Begins to use adults or older children as “agents” to help (hands a closed jar to an adult to be opened) 
 Shows goal-directed behavior such as repeatedly trying to fit a shape into a sorter until it goes in.

    INDICATOR: Cause-and-Effect Exploration: Repeats actions to see outcomes (e.g., drops spoon from high chair to watch caregiver pick it up, repeatedly pushes a button to make a toy pop up) 
 Distinguishes their own actions from the results (realizes “I made that happen”). Uses actions to test object properties (shakes, bangs, throws objects to observe effects like sound or breakage) 


    INDICATOR: Spatial Exploration: Explores space and object location. Watches moving objects intently and searches for partially hidden ones 
 Crawls into, under, and over things. Drops toys into containers and dumps them out, learning about “in, out, empty, full” 
 Can find a toy that rolled under furniture by looking to the other side (understands object may reappear elsewhere).

    INDICATOR: Spatial Problem-Solving: Persists in finding hidden objects (if a ball rolls under a couch, will go around to the other side to get it). Tries to navigate around obstacles (moves around a pillow blocking the path). Stacks a few blocks, figuring out how to balance them 
 Uses simple means to overcome barriers (pulls a cloth to bring a toy closer).

    INDICATOR: Object Permanence: Understands that objects still exist when out of sight. By ~8–12 months, will actively search for a toy hidden under a blanket 
 By 18–24 months, can handle more complex hide-and-find games (finds a toy hidden under one of two cups, for example).

    INDICATOR: Symbolic Thought & Representation: Develops mental representation of objects/events. Towards 2 years, engages in simple pretend play (uses a block as a “phone”, or pretends to feed a doll) 
 Points to pictures in books and recognizes they represent real things. Begins to recall past events (shows a toy to where something happened yesterday, indicating memory of event). Early signs of understanding images or gestures can stand for real objects.

    INDICATOR: Memory: Recognizes familiar people, toys, and routines. Anticipates events (gets excited when seeing a bottle because they remember it means feeding time). By 12–18 months, remembers where favorite toys are usually kept. Shows object permanence as noted, indicating memory of unseen object.

    INDICATOR: Sorting: Groups objects in a simple way. Toward 2 years, may start grouping like items together (e.g., puts all the toy cars in one pile, or sorts shapes roughly by color). Discriminates between categories in play (might give the toy dog a pretend “bone” but the toy doll a “bottle”). This is the start of recognizing similarities and differences.

Toddler (14 months to 3 years)  

    INDICATOR: Attention Regulation: Able to concentrate for longer periods on interesting activities, though still easily distracted by new events. Can engage in self-chosen play (like stacking blocks or looking at books) for several minutes. Begins to ignore minor distractions when really focused, but attention can be interrupted by loud or novel stimuli 


    INDICATOR: Problem Solving: Approaches new challenges with experimentation. Tries out different actions to achieve goals (e.g., uses a stool to reach a toy on a shelf, or pulls over a basket to stand on). Solves simple problems by trial and error and with some planning (may gather all puzzle pieces, then try to fit them). Will seek help from adults when stuck, indicating awareness of others as resources.

    INDICATOR: Cause-and-Effect Exploration: Delights in predictable outcomes (laughs at jack-in-the-box repeatedly). Actively experiments with how things work (opens and closes doors, pushes buttons, turns knobs). Might ask “What happen if…?” through actions if not words (e.g., intentionally spills water to see the reaction). Enjoys cause-effect toys and begins to predict outcomes of actions (knows ball will roll down slide, etc.) 


    INDICATOR: Spatial Exploration: Explores how things fit and relate in space. Fills and empties containers with objects, nests cups or boxes. Tries different spatial relationships – like putting objects together and taking them apart (e.g., building with Duplos, then pulling them apart) 
 Climbs into boxes or small spaces; navigates playground obstacles. Uses spatial words in play (“in”, “on”, “under” by around 3).

    INDICATOR: Spatial Problem-Solving: Uses more complex strategies to overcome barriers. For example, will push or move obstacles out of the way to get what they want 
 Uses simple tools to solve problems (might use a stick to draw a toy closer). Stacks more blocks or items by adjusting placement to prevent falling. Shows persistence – if a shape doesn’t fit one way, tries rotating it or uses another shape.

    INDICATOR: Temporal Understanding: Begins to grasp time concepts in a simple way. Understands routines and what comes next (“after nap, then snack”). Learns words like “now,” “later,” “soon,” and uses them, albeit not always accurately. By 3, uses “yesterday” and “tomorrow” but may not comprehend them fully 
 Associates times of day with activities (“night-night” for bedtime, etc.).

    INDICATOR: Symbolic Thought & Pretend Play: Engages in imaginative play using symbols – uses objects to represent something else (a banana as a phone) 
 Acts out simple scenarios (feeds stuffed animals, pretends to cook). Drawings are mostly scribbles, but may say what it represents (“This is mommy”). Language explosion aids symbolic thought, so they start telling simple make-believe stories.

    INDICATOR: Memory: Improves in recall of people, places, and routines. Remembers where things belong and can fetch an item from another room upon request. Recalls recent events (“We went to the zoo!”) and can hold a simple idea in mind (like remembering to bring a toy along). Still primarily remembers through repetition and familiar context.

    INDICATOR: Sorting & Classifying: Sorts objects by one feature (all red blocks vs. blue blocks, or grouping all cars separate from dolls) 
 By 2–3, matches simple shapes and colors. Begins to classify things in their talk (“Animals” vs “People” toys). Can identify differences like big/little, and starts to organize toys accordingly.
