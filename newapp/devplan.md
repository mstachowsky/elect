## ELECT Summary

Summary should focus on the three most obvious domains and indicators. This should work by using the current method to generate the whole report as it currently does
then summarizing THAT plus the interaction in a more focused, parent-friendly way

ELECT summary should extract the indicators and record stuff in a DB for each account/child. The 
purpose  of this will be to eventually guide the conversation to prompt "did you notice X", where X
is from a domain that wasn't usually explored, and then to suggest activities that deepen that
theme.

So yeah, really need to figure out the DB at least for an interaction if not the whole thing.

## Activity formats

Think about a better format for the activity, including things like materials, steps, and things to
look for, and possible extensions and adaptations.

## Chat interface

Make it so that it handles different formatting properly. Currently it just dumps the text.
Also make the damn chat window bigger, and make the chat extend vertically instead of horizontally

AUTH! So basically...auth is REALLY sketchy. I can log in, I can log out. I cannot access chat when logged out. So far, so good. However, the fix I had for the initial message runs only when the endpoint does, NOT on page load. So you don't see the initial message anymore. I need to fix this, probably by just having the initial chat message...honestly, just be shown. Like, why are we going through the LLM for this? Just set up the message history immediately with a starting prompt. That will be a later problem.

We also need a way to navigate this app. Right now you can't do ANYTHING from the chat window, and it is really hard to log in. BRILLIANT: why don't we make the root route auth, instead of chat? And auth needs to redirect us if a successful login. Either way, lots of debugging but we have auth, and once we have auth we are halfway to anywhere
