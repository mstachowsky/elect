## ELECT Summary

Summary should focus on the three most obvious domains and indicators. This should work by using the current method to generate the whole report as it currently does
then summarizing THAT plus the interaction in a more focused, parent-friendly way

ELECT summary should extract the indicators and record stuff in a DB for each account/child. The 
purpose  of this will be to eventually guide the conversation to prompt "did you notice X", where X
is from a domain that wasn't usually explored, and then to suggest activities that deepen that
theme.

So yeah, really need to figure out the DB at least for an interaction if not the whole thing.

## Activity formats

Think about a better format for the activity, including things like materials, steps, and things to
look for, and possible extensions and adaptations.

## Chat interface

Make it so that it handles different formatting properly. Currently it just dumps the text.
Also make the damn chat window bigger, and make the chat extend vertically instead of horizontally
