Assistant: Hello! To start, I'd love to hear about what your toddler did today. What was a memorable activity or moment for them?
User: she started using the sign for "again" for the first time. I've been demonstrating the sign for her for the past couple of weeks. She also sees it on the Ms. Rachel show. We were singing "row row row your boat" and when we finished she signed again. She did this every time the song finished. This happened about ten times.
Assistant: That’s wonderful! It sounds like she made a big leap in communication today. Did she seem excited or pleased when you responded by starting the song over each time she signed “again”?
User: she did seem pleased. She likes singing a lot
Assistant: That's so sweet! Did you notice if she tried to use the "again" sign for anything else today, or was it just during singing with you?
User: only during singing
Assistant: Great observation! When she signed “again” and you responded by singing, how did she react physically or emotionally? Did she smile, laugh, or show other signs of connection during this exchange?
User: she looked at me and smiled. She also expressed displeasure by crying once I stopped singing the song repeatedly
Assistant: Thank you for sharing these details. Would you like a summary of today’s learning episode, or would you like to keep exploring her experience together?
User: summary please
Assistant: Here’s a summary of your toddler’s learning episode:

Today, your child made a big step in expressive communication by using the sign for “again” on her own for the first time. This is a wonderful indicator of her growing language skills—she’s connecting gestures with meaning and understanding how to use them to communicate her desires. By repeating the sign each time the song ended and looking to you for a response, she was practicing key aspects of social interaction: turn-taking, making requests, and seeing that her communication has an effect (when she signed, you sang again!).

Her reaction—smiling and showing joy when you responded, as well as sadness when the game stopped—shows her growing emotional engagement and her ability to communicate likes and dislikes in more ways than just crying. It’s also a sign of strong attachment and connection with you, as she trusts you to understand and respond to her needs.

Developmentally, these skills are right on track for toddlers: she's learning to express herself, to participate in back-and-forth communication, and to understand social cues, all of which are foundational for later language and social development.

**Deepening Activity Idea:**  
To keep this learning going, you might try introducing the “again” sign in other favorite activities—such as reading a short book, playing a tickle game, or building a simple block tower. Each time you finish an activity, pause and wait to see if she uses the sign. If she does, respond enthusiastically and repeat the activity together. This helps her understand that communication can be used in many contexts, not just for singing, and supports both her language development and her confidence in expressing herself.
