Please share some details about the learning episode you observed with your toddler, so I can determine which social development indicators were clearly observed.Emotional Domain
Since the parent shared that their toddler used the sign for milk, here is the analysis of the indicators based on that:

No indicators from the Emotional Domain document were clearly observed solely from the toddler using the sign for milk. If you can provide more details about the context, emotions, or behaviors during the episode, I can better match indicators.Communication, Language, and Literacy Domain
INDICATOR: Receptive Language: Understands much more than they can say. Follows simple two-step instructions (“Pick up the toy and give it to me”). Identifies named objects and body parts (points to nose when asked)  
Your toddler demonstrated understanding by using the sign for milk, showing comprehension of the concept before verbal expression.

INDICATOR: Expressive Language: Rapid growth in spoken vocabulary and sentence use  
The use of the sign for milk indicates emerging expressive communication beyond spoken words.

INDICATOR: Vocabulary: Continually learning new words; can name everyday items, people, and actions. By 3, often asks for names of unknown objects (curiosity). Also starts identifying functions of items (e.g., “Key – open door”)  
Your toddler’s use of the milk sign shows recognition and communication of a common daily item.

INDICATOR: Conversation: Attempts simple conversation turns – will respond when spoken to and initiate talk about immediate things (“Look – truck!”). By 3, observes others talking and tries to join, though might be off-topic. Begins to use language to greet, protest, request, and comment in social interactions  
By using a sign to communicate, your toddler initiated a request or comment about a current need or desire, engaging in early conversational exchange.Cognitive Domain
