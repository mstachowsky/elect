INDICATOR: Sensory Exploration & Discrimination: Uses all senses to explore object properties (pours, dumps, fills containers; examines textures and sounds)  
Observed when your toddler engaged in singing and responding to auditory stimuli, showing recognition of the song’s rhythm and sound patterns.

INDICATOR: Sensory-Motor Integration: Combines sensory input with actions in more complex ways (e.g., threads large beads on a pipe cleaner, does simple puzzles, coordinates hand-eye movements in play)  
Observed as your toddler used the sign for "again," coordinating visual cues and hand movements to communicate her desire related to the song.

Social Domain
Social Interest: Observes and plays alongside other children (may imitate peers, initiate “follow the leader” style chasing games)  
There was no observation of the toddler interacting or playing alongside other children during the learning episode.

Perspective-Taking: In simple situations, starts to understand others’ feelings or intentions (e.g., notices if a peer is sad or waiting for a turn, with adult help begins to learn how to respond)  
There was no clear observation of the toddler recognizing or responding to others’ feelings or intentions in the episode described.

Parallel Play: Plays near other children with similar toys but with little interaction (e.g., two toddlers building blocks side by side each with their own blocks)  
No interaction with other children was observed during this learning episode.

Emotional Domain
Expression of Feelings: Expresses a wide range of emotions more boldly (e.g., may have tantrums when angry or frustrated; shows joy, affection, fear openly)  
She expressed joy by smiling when the song was repeated and showed displeasure by crying when the singing stopped.

Autonomy: Insists on doing things by self (“I do it!”). Sets simple goals and persists (e.g., tries to put on shoes, stack blocks repeatedly)  
She insisted on using the sign for “again” repeatedly to restart the song, demonstrating persistence and choice.

Sense of Self: Achieves stronger self-recognition and independence (e.g., says “no” to assert self, recognizes self in mirror and photos)  
By using the sign for “again” to communicate her wishes, she showed emerging independence in expressing her needs.

Communication, Language, and Literacy Domain
Receptive Language: Understands much more than they can say. Follows simple two-step instructions (“Pick up the toy and give it to me”). Identifies named objects and body parts (points to nose when asked)  
She understood the meaning of the “again” sign through repeated exposure and responded appropriately by signaling for the song to be repeated.

Expressive Language: Rapid growth in spoken vocabulary and sentence use  
Her first successful use of the “again” sign shows growth in expressive communication through gestures.

Conversation: Attempts simple conversation turns – will respond when spoken to and initiate talk about immediate things (“Look – truck!”). By 3, observes others talking and tries to join, though might be off-topic. Begins to use language to greet, protest, request, and comment in social interactions  
She initiated communication by signing “again” to request the song’s repetition and responded emotionally to the interaction, demonstrating early back-and-forth communication skills.

Cognitive Domain
Attention Regulation: Your toddler maintained focus on the singing and signing activity for about ten repetitions, showing sustained attention and engagement.

Symbolic Thought & Pretend Play: She used the sign “again” symbolically to represent her desire to repeat the song, demonstrating early use of symbols in communication.

Memory: She remembered to use the sign “again” each time the song ended, indicating recall of the sign’s meaning and connection to the event.
