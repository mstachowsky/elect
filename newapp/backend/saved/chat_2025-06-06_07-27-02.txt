Assistant: ## Summary:

Today, your toddler signed for milk during play, and you responded by offering milk right away. This short episode highlights several important areas of your child's development:

- **Communication Skills**: By using the milk sign independently, your child is expressing their needs before they can do so with spoken words. This is a strong sign of growing communication abilities, showing they understand how to use gestures to get their needs met.  
- **Social-Emotional Development**: Feeling happy after you responded shows your child is learning that they can trust you to understand and meet their requests. This kind of positive back-and-forth (they ask, you respond) builds a sense of security and connection.  
- **Emergent Independence**: Recognizing and expressing needs during play shows that your child is becoming more aware of themselves and able to communicate even when absorbed in another activity.

These moments, though small, are important steps in your childâ€™s journey toward more complex language and social skills!

Here's some information for you about how this interaction lines up with child development indicators:  
1. **Expressive Communication:** Your child used sign language to let you know they wanted milk, which shows they are learning to express their needs before they can use spoken words.  

2. **Social Connection:** By signing for milk and being happy when you responded, your child is building trust and learning that they can communicate with you and have their needs met.  

3. **Problem Solving:** Your child recognized they were thirsty and remembered to use the sign for milk, showing they are already figuring out how to solve problems and get what they need.

Would you like an idea for a deepening activity to keep supporting this kind of learning?
