Assistant: ## Summary:  
Today, your toddler showed an important communication skill by signing for milk during playtime. When you responded by giving them milk, your child expressed happiness—showing that they felt understood and connected. This episode is a wonderful example of your child’s growing ability to express their needs and desires, which is a key milestone in both language and social-emotional development. Using signs, words, or gestures helps toddlers build early language skills before they're able to fully speak, and it strengthens your relationship by fostering trust and responsiveness. Your attentive response also supports your child’s confidence in using communication to get their needs met.

Here's some information for you about how this interaction lines up with child development indicators:  
1. **Expressive Communication Skills:** Your child used a sign to clearly tell you they wanted milk, showing exciting growth in how they express their needs even before using full words.

2. **Social Connection and Back-and-Forth Interaction:** By signing and then reacting with happiness when you responded, your toddler is building early conversation skills and connecting with you through a simple, meaningful exchange.

3. **Independence and Problem-Solving:** Your child showed independence by taking initiative to ask for what they wanted, and problem-solving by using a sign to get their needs met during playtime.

Would you like an idea for an age-appropriate activity to help keep building these skills?
