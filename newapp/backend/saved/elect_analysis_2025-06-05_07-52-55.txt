Physical Domain
Based on the learning episode you described where your toddler asked for milk using signs, I will review the indicators for any clearly observed behaviors:

No indicators from the Physical Domain were clearly observed in this episode, as it focused on communication through signing rather than physical motor skills or sensory exploration. If you have another episode involving physical actions or play, I can help identify observed indicators then.Social Domain
Since the learning episode shared involves the toddler asking for milk using signs that were taught by the parent, here is the evaluation of the Social Domain indicators:

INDICATOR: Social Interest: Observes and plays alongside other children (may imitate peers, initiate “follow the leader” style chasing games) Offers toys to others and seeks brief play with peers.  
- This indicator was not clearly observed in the described learning episode, as it focused on communication with an adult rather than interaction with peers.

INDICATOR: Perspective-Taking: In simple situations, starts to understand others’ feelings or intentions (e.g., notices if a peer is sad or waiting for a turn, with adult help begins to learn how to respond)  
- This indicator was not clearly observed in the described learning episode, since the focus was on requesting an item rather than interpreting others’ feelings or intentions.

INDICATOR: Parallel Play: Plays near other children with similar toys but with little interaction (e.g., two toddlers building blocks side by side each with their own blocks) Comfortable being alongside peers even if not sharing a joint activity.  
- This indicator was not clearly observed as the learning episode did not involve play alongside or near peers.

Emotional Domain
INDICATOR: Expression of Feelings: Expresses a wide range of emotions more boldly (e.g., may have tantrums when angry or frustrated; shows joy, affection, fear openly)  
She expressed her need for milk clearly by using signs, showing her ability to communicate feelings and desires.

INDICATOR: Autonomy: Insists on doing things by self (“I do it!”). Sets simple goals and persists (e.g., tries to put on shoes, stack blocks repeatedly)  
By using signs to ask for milk, she demonstrated a desire to communicate independently and have her needs met on her own terms.Communication, Language, and Literacy Domain
INDICATOR: Expressive Language: Rapid growth in spoken vocabulary and sentence use  
The toddler communicated her need for milk using signs, showing growth in using language, even if not yet spoken.

INDICATOR: Words: Begins combining words into two-word phrases (“more juice”, “mommy go”) and uses common verbs/adjectives in speech  
Although expressed through signs rather than spoken words, the toddler used a symbolic form of language to request something.

INDICATOR: Conversation: Attempts simple conversation turns – will respond when spoken to and initiate talk about immediate things (“Look – truck!”). By 3, observes others talking and tries to join, though might be off-topic. Begins to use language to greet, protest, request, and comment in social interactions  
The toddler initiated communication by signing to request milk, showing early attempts at conversational turns through nonverbal language.

Cognitive Domain
Based on the learning episode you described (your toddler asking for milk using signs), here are the indicators that were clearly observed:

INDICATOR: Memory  
Your toddler remembered the sign for milk and used it to communicate her need, showing recall of learned signs and their meaning.

INDICATOR: Symbolic Thought & Pretend Play  
Using signs to represent a real-life request demonstrates early symbolic understanding, as she used a symbol (the sign) to convey a specific idea (asking for milk).
