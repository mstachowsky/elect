INDICATOR: Receptive Language: Understands much more than they can say. Follows simple two-step instructions (“Pick up the toy and give it to me”). Identifies named objects and body parts (points to nose when asked)  
The toddler followed a two-step instruction by picking up a toy and giving it to the parent, showing understanding beyond their spoken abilities.

INDICATOR: Expressive Language: Rapid growth in spoken vocabulary and sentence use  
The toddler used new words and short phrases during the episode, demonstrating increased vocabulary and sentence use.

INDICATOR: Words: Begins combining words into two-word phrases (“more juice”, “mommy go”) and uses common verbs/adjectives in speech  
The toddler combined two words, such as “more juice,” indicating early phrase use.

INDICATOR: Sentences: Progresses to using simple sentences by age 2–3 (e.g., “I want cookie”). Starts to use some compound sentences and includes language in pretend play (“You be the baby, I’m the mommy”)  
The toddler used simple sentences like “I want toy” and engaged in pretend play language with the parent.

INDICATOR: Vocabulary: Continually learning new words; can name everyday items, people, and actions. By 3, often asks for names of unknown objects (curiosity). Also starts identifying functions of items (e.g., “Key – open door”)  
The toddler named several everyday items during play and identified their uses.

INDICATOR: Questions: Frequently asks questions, especially “what’s that?” and “where?” questions as language expands (e.g., “Where go?” when something/someone is missing)  
The toddler asked “What’s that?” when seeing new objects, showing curiosity.

INDICATOR: Conversation: Attempts simple conversation turns – will respond when spoken to and initiate talk about immediate things (“Look – truck!”). By 3, observes others talking and tries to join, though might be off-topic. Begins to use language to greet, protest, request, and comment in social interactions  
The toddler initiated conversation by commenting on nearby toys and responded when spoken to by the parent.

Attention Regulation: Able to concentrate for longer periods on interesting activities, though still easily distracted by new events. Can engage in self-chosen play (like stacking blocks or looking at books) for several minutes. Begins to ignore minor distractions when really focused, but attention can be interrupted by loud or novel stimuli  
- The toddler focused intently on stacking blocks for several minutes despite minor distractions in the environment.

Problem Solving: Approaches new challenges with experimentation. Tries out different actions to achieve goals (e.g., uses a stool to reach a toy on a shelf, or pulls over a basket to stand on). Solves simple problems by trial and error and with some planning (may gather all puzzle pieces, then try to fit them). Will seek help from adults when stuck, indicating awareness of others as resources.  
- The toddler tried various methods to fit puzzle pieces together and asked for help when unable to complete a section.

Cause-and-Effect Exploration: Delights in predictable outcomes (laughs at jack-in-the-box repeatedly). Actively experiments with how things work (opens and closes doors, pushes buttons, turns knobs). Might ask “What happen if…?” through actions if not words (e.g., intentionally spills water to see the reaction). Enjoys cause-effect toys and begins to predict outcomes of actions (knows ball will roll down slide, etc.)  
- The toddler repeatedly pressed buttons on a toy to see lights and sounds activate, smiling each time.

Spatial Exploration: Explores how things fit and relate in space. Fills and empties containers with objects, nests cups or boxes. Tries different spatial relationships – like putting objects together and taking them apart (e.g., building with Duplos, then pulling them apart)  
- The toddler filled a container with blocks, then emptied it out and stacked some blocks together.

Spatial Problem-Solving: Uses more complex strategies to overcome barriers. For example, will push or move obstacles out of the way to get what they want Uses simple tools to solve problems (might use a stick to draw a toy closer). Stacks more blocks or items by adjusting placement to prevent falling. Shows persistence – if a shape doesn’t fit one way, tries rotating it or uses another shape.  
- The toddler rotated puzzle pieces and tried multiple approaches until the pieces fit correctly.

Symbolic Thought & Pretend Play: Engages in imaginative play using symbols – uses objects to represent something else (a banana as a phone) Acts out simple scenarios (feeds stuffed animals, pretends to cook). Drawings are mostly scribbles, but may say what it represents (“This is mommy”). Language explosion aids symbolic thought, so they start telling simple make-believe stories.  
- The toddler pretended a block was a car and made driving sounds while pushing it around.

Memory: Improves in recall of people, places, and routines. Remembers where things belong and can fetch an item from another room upon request. Recalls recent events (“We went to the zoo!”) and can hold a simple idea in mind (like remembering to bring a toy along). Still primarily remembers through repetition and familiar context.  
- The toddler remembered where their favorite toy was kept and went to get it when asked.

Sorting & Classifying: Sorts objects by one feature (all red blocks vs. blue blocks, or grouping all cars separate from dolls) By 2–3, matches simple shapes and colors. Begins to classify things in their talk (“Animals” vs “People” toys). Can identify differences like big/little, and starts to organize toys accordingly.  
- The toddler grouped blocks by color, placing all red blocks together separate from the blue ones.
