### Physical Domain
Infant (Birth to 24 months)  

    INDICATOR: Gross Motor: Develops basic body control (e.g., reaches for objects, rolls over, sits without support, crawls; pulls to stand, cruises, begins walking)     .

    INDICATOR: Fine Motor: Refines hand grasp and coordination (e.g., palmar grasp of objects, transfers items hand-to-hand, developing pincer grasp with thumb and forefinger)     . Uses simple tools (e.g., first crayon marks, scribbling) 


    INDICATOR: Sensory Exploration: Uses all senses to explore (e.g., prefers faces, tracks moving objects visually; shakes/bangs objects to hear sound; touches and mouths new items)     . Shows early sensory discrimination (turns toward familiar voices or smells, prefers certain textures or tastes)     .

    INDICATOR: Sensory-Motor Integration: Coordinates senses with actions (e.g., looks at a toy and then reaches for it; hears a sound and crawls toward it)     .

### Social Domain
Infant (Birth to 24 months)  

    INDICATOR: Social Interest: Shows interest in people over objects (e.g., prefers human faces, seeks attention from caregivers, watches peers) 
 Smiles and engages with adults to initiate interaction.

    INDICATOR: Imitation: Imitates others’ actions and expressions (copies adult facial movements, later tries simple pretend play like “feeding” a doll) 
 Learns through “copycat” games.

    INDICATOR: Simple Turn-Taking: Engages in back-and-forth social games (e.g., plays peekaboo or takes turns making sounds) 
 Anticipates another’s turn in simple play.

    INDICATOR: Maintaining Connection Across Space: Uses sounds, gestures, or eye contact to stay connected with an adult when not held (e.g., makes eye contact from across the room to “check in” with caregiver) 


### Emotional Domain
Infant (Birth to 24 months)  

    INDICATOR: Expression of Emotion: Expresses a range of feelings primarily through crying, smiling, and body language (e.g., comfort/discomfort, pleasure/displeasure, excitement, anxiety) 
 Shows affection (hugs, cuddles) and early signs of separation anxiety with caregivers.

    INDICATOR: Self-Regulation: Begins learning to soothe themselves with support (e.g., calms when held by familiar adult, sucks thumb or pacifier to cope with stress) 
 Gradually recovers from upsets given a secure, calming presence.

    INDICATOR: Sense of Self: Shows emerging self-awareness (e.g., plays with own hands/feet, observes own reflection briefly)     . May suck fingers or inspect body parts as an early recognition of self.

    INDICATOR: Empathy: Responds to others’ emotions in a basic way (may get distressed hearing another infant cry, or pat someone who is upset)     .

    INDICATOR: Agency: Begins to realize they can cause actions (e.g., bangs a toy to make noise, raises arms to be picked up – expecting an adult response) 
 Shows intentional behavior to get effect or attention.
 
 ### Communication, Language, and Literacy Domain
Infant (Birth to 24 months)  

    INDICATOR: Non-verbal Communication: Develops early communication through eye contact and gestures. Referencing: checks in with caregiver visually during play 
 INDICATOR: Joint Attention: follows others’ gaze and points to share interest (looks where adult points or looks) 
 
INDICATOR:  Gestures: uses simple gestures like waving, shaking head “no,” reaching up to be held 

 INDICATOR: Intentional Communication: uses gestures or vocalizations deliberately to get needs met (e.g., points at desired object) 
 
 INDICATOR: Simple Turn-Taking: engages in back-and-forth vocal play or imitation games with an adult 


    INDICATOR: Receptive Language: Recognizes familiar voices and sounds. By around 6 months, distinguishes tones of the home language 
 Responds to own name and simple words (may look at “ball” when said, point to familiar people or body parts on request) 
 Begins to follow simple directions paired with gestures.

    INDICATOR: Expressive Language: Communicates primarily through sounds and a few early words. 
	
	INDICATOR: Signaling: uses cries, facial expressions, and body movements to indicate needs or feelings
	
 INDICATOR: Vocalizing/Babbling: babbles strings of sounds (“bababa”) and uses vocalizations to get attention or initiate social contact 
 
 INDICATOR: One-Word Stage: around 12–18 months, uses single words (or word approximations) to label or request (“milk,” “up”) 
 
 INDICATOR: Words with Gestures: combines words with gestures (says “eat” while reaching for food) and gradually starts using two-word combos towards 24 months 
 
 INDICATOR: Vocabulary Growth: learns new words each month; by 18–24 months may use ~50+ words and start saying “me,” “you,” “I” in rudimentary ways 

### Cognitive Domain
Infant (Birth to 24 months)  

    INDICATOR: Attention Regulation: Attention span is short but increasing. Infants focus on interesting stimuli, and by the end of this period can shift and re-engage attention with growing control (e.g., will attend to a toy, look away when bored or overstimulated, then return focus if it’s presented again) 


    INDICATOR: Problem Solving: Explores solving simple challenges through trial and error (e.g., figuring out how to get a toy that's out of reach by pulling a blanket, or pressing a button to make a sound) 
 Begins to use adults or older children as “agents” to help (hands a closed jar to an adult to be opened) 
 Shows goal-directed behavior such as repeatedly trying to fit a shape into a sorter until it goes in.

    INDICATOR: Cause-and-Effect Exploration: Repeats actions to see outcomes (e.g., drops spoon from high chair to watch caregiver pick it up, repeatedly pushes a button to make a toy pop up) 
 Distinguishes their own actions from the results (realizes “I made that happen”). Uses actions to test object properties (shakes, bangs, throws objects to observe effects like sound or breakage) 


    INDICATOR: Spatial Exploration: Explores space and object location. Watches moving objects intently and searches for partially hidden ones 
 Crawls into, under, and over things. Drops toys into containers and dumps them out, learning about “in, out, empty, full” 
 Can find a toy that rolled under furniture by looking to the other side (understands object may reappear elsewhere).

    INDICATOR: Spatial Problem-Solving: Persists in finding hidden objects (if a ball rolls under a couch, will go around to the other side to get it). Tries to navigate around obstacles (moves around a pillow blocking the path). Stacks a few blocks, figuring out how to balance them 
 Uses simple means to overcome barriers (pulls a cloth to bring a toy closer).

    INDICATOR: Object Permanence: Understands that objects still exist when out of sight. By ~8–12 months, will actively search for a toy hidden under a blanket 
 By 18–24 months, can handle more complex hide-and-find games (finds a toy hidden under one of two cups, for example).

    INDICATOR: Symbolic Thought & Representation: Develops mental representation of objects/events. Towards 2 years, engages in simple pretend play (uses a block as a “phone”, or pretends to feed a doll) 
 Points to pictures in books and recognizes they represent real things. Begins to recall past events (shows a toy to where something happened yesterday, indicating memory of event). Early signs of understanding images or gestures can stand for real objects.

    INDICATOR: Memory: Recognizes familiar people, toys, and routines. Anticipates events (gets excited when seeing a bottle because they remember it means feeding time). By 12–18 months, remembers where favorite toys are usually kept. Shows object permanence as noted, indicating memory of unseen object.

    INDICATOR: Sorting: Groups objects in a simple way. Toward 2 years, may start grouping like items together (e.g., puts all the toy cars in one pile, or sorts shapes roughly by color). Discriminates between categories in play (might give the toy dog a pretend “bone” but the toy doll a “bottle”). This is the start of recognizing similarities and differences.
