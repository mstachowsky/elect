        .

        INDICATOR: Vocabulary: Continually learning new words; can name everyday items, people, and actions. By 3, often asks for names of unknown objects (curiosity). Also starts identifying functions of items (e.g., “Key – open door”) 
        
        .

        INDICATOR: Questions: Frequently asks questions, especially “what’s that?” and “where?” questions as language expands (e.g., “Where go?” when something/someone is missing)

        .


### Cognitive Domain
    INDICATOR: Attention Regulation: Able to concentrate for longer periods on interesting activities, though still easily distracted by new events. Can engage in self-chosen play (like stacking blocks or looking at books) for several minutes. Begins to ignore minor distractions when really focused, but attention can be interrupted by loud or novel stimuli 


    INDICATOR: Problem Solving: Approaches new challenges with experimentation. Tries out different actions to achieve goals (e.g., uses a stool to reach a toy on a shelf, or pulls over a basket to stand on). Solves simple problems by trial and error and with some planning (may gather all puzzle pieces, then try to fit them). Will seek help from adults when stuck, indicating awareness of others as resources.

    INDICATOR: Cause-and-Effect Exploration: Delights in predictable outcomes (laughs at jack-in-the-box repeatedly). Actively experiments with how things work (opens and closes doors, pushes buttons, turns knobs).

    INDICATOR: Spatial Problem-Solving: Uses more complex strategies to overcome barriers. For example, will push or move obstacles out of the way to get what they want 
 Uses simple tools to solve problems (might use a stick to draw a toy closer). Stacks more blocks or items by adjusting placement to prevent falling. Shows persistence – if a shape doesn’t fit one way, tries rotating it or uses another shape.
