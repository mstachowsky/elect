    Reflecting & Reaching Conclusions: After exploring, can state simple conclusions (“All the heavy things sank and the light things floated!”). Describes cause-and-effect in familiar events (“We watered the plant and it grew”). Can explain their thinking: “I think the ice melted because it got warm.” Begins to understand and verbalize reasons for outcomes in experiments or daily events 


    Communicating Findings: Shares what they learned or observed, through drawing, talking, or play-acting. For instance, after a nature walk, can tell the group “We saw three birds and one was building a nest” (reporting observations). Might make a drawing to show something they discovered. Uses increasingly specific language to describe results (“The ball rolled faster on the smooth floor than on the carpet”).

    Reasoning Logically: Starts applying logic to everyday situations. Can do simple reasoning tasks like sorting out a simple riddle or figuring out what might happen next in a story. Understands basic logical connections (if it’s cloudy, it might rain; if you add more blocks on one side, it will tip over). Can categorize objects by two features (e.g., find the big, red blocks – combining size and color criteria) 


    Classifying: Sorts and groups objects by multiple attributes. For example, in kindergarten, can sort a pile of shapes by color and type (red triangles in one group, blue triangles in another, etc.) 
 Understands the concept of categories and sub-categories (“fruit” vs specific fruits). Uses classification in understanding the world (knows whales are mammals even though they live in water, etc., with guidance).

    Seriating: Can arrange objects in a logical order (e.g., line up sticks from shortest to longest, or arrange numbers in sequence) 
 Understands sequences like first, second, third in daily routines. Can compare and order numbers of objects (which set has 1st most, 2nd most, etc.).

    Counting: Counts objects accurately one-to-one (by age 4 can count up to ~10 objects, by 5 can go higher) 
 Understands the last number counted represents the total quantity. Starts doing mental counting without needing to point at each item by kindergarten. Recognizes numerals and can count out a specific number of items when asked.

    Determining Quantity: Grasps concepts of “more”, “less”, or “same” by comparing sets of objects 
 Can tell who has more cookies and who has fewer. By 5, begins to understand basic addition/subtraction concretely (e.g., if we add one more apple to the 3, we have 4).

    Comparing Quantities: Uses comparison words properly (bigger/smaller, more/fewer, heavier/lighter). Can compare two numbers or sizes and say which is greater. Can arrange 3 or more sets or objects in order (like sorting cups of water from emptiest to fullest).

    Representing Numbers: Recognizes that written numbers symbolize amounts. Can match the numeral “5” to a picture of five objects 

 Begins writing numbers and drawing simple graphs or tallies to represent quantities. Understands that numbers can represent things in real life (age, address, phone number).

    Ordinal Numbers & Position: Understands and uses terms like first, second, third, last in context (e.g., “I was first in line”). Grasps positional concepts (above, below, next to, between) and can follow or give simple directions using them 


    Understanding Shapes: Identifies basic 2D shapes (circle, square, triangle, etc.) and some 3D shapes (sphere/ball, cube/block) 
 Can describe shapes by attributes (e.g., “a triangle has three sides”). Sorts shapes and can create pictures or patterns using shapes. By 5, starts to recognize less common shapes (hexagon, etc.) from learning materials.

    Identifying Patterns: Recognizes repeating patterns (in beads, colors, daily routine). Can copy a simple ABAB pattern and create their own (using stamps, blocks, etc.). By kindergarten, can extend more complex patterns (ABC, AABB) and identify the unit that repeats. Notices patterns in stories or songs (like repeating refrains).

    Measuring: Uses non-standard units to measure (like footsteps to measure length of a rug) and begins to use standard measurement terms (in play will use a ruler, or say something is big/heavy). Understands basic comparisons of length, weight, and capacity (e.g., which is longer, holds more). By 5–6, is aware of time concepts (morning, afternoon, days of week) and can sequence daily events. Starts to grasp concepts of money (recognizes coins/bills) and other measures with adult guidance 


    Completing Simple Number Operations: Performs simple arithmetic with concrete objects or fingers. By 4, can do basic addition/subtraction with totals up to ~5 (like “I have 2 apples and get 1 more, now I have 3”). By 6, can solve simple math problems up to 10 using counting strategies. Understands the idea of adding to make “more” or taking away to make “less” 



    Using Number Symbols & Operations: Begins to write basic equations in informal ways (may scribble numbers to show their math). In kindergarten, might solve and write simple addition/subtraction equations with help (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). Recognizes the plus, minus, and equals signs and what they mean by the end of this period.

    Spatial Relations, Directions, Maps: Understands and uses directional words (left/right by 5–6 with practice, up/down, behind/in front). Can follow a simple map or create one of a familiar place (like drawing their classroom layout with tables, play area). Solves simple mazes and navigates computer game maps or board game layouts. Knows their address or how to describe where they live by 6–7. Enjoys treasure hunts with simple map clues 


School-Age (5 to 8 years) 
 

    Self-Regulation (Executive Function): Shows increased ability to plan, focus, and remember instructions. Can sit and work on a task in class for an extended time (e.g., 15–20 minutes in early primary). Uses strategies to avoid distraction (might cover eyes during a scary part of a movie, or move to a quieter spot to concentrate on homework). Follows multi-step directions reliably.

    Problem-Solving: Thinks through problems more systematically. Can identify a problem, consider a couple of possible solutions, and choose the best approach. Solves puzzles and age-appropriate academic problems (like word problems) using logic and learned strategies. Begins to apply past knowledge to new situations (transfer skills).

    Representation: Engages in more complex symbolic and imaginative play, but also starts to use symbols in a academic way. For instance, uses drawings or diagrams to represent scientific ideas (draws life cycle of a butterfly). Enjoys symbolic games like chess or checkers where pieces stand for roles, or coding games using symbols.

    Memory: Significant improvements in memory capacity and strategy. Remembers events in detail (can recount what happened on a vacation last year). Learns and recalls facts (like simple math facts, spelling words). Uses memory strategies (rehearsing, grouping information) by around 7–8 with guidance. Working memory allows following of longer instructions and mental math.

    Inquiry: Takes an inquiry-based approach to learning – asks in-depth “how” and “why” questions and seeks out answers (may attempt small experiments or research in books/online with help) 
 Can form a simple hypothesis (“I think plants grow taller with more light”) and observe outcomes. Enjoys investigative play and science activities, demonstrating planning, observation, and conclusion drawing.

    Classifying: Sorts and classifies with multiple criteria confidently. Can create taxonomies (e.g., sort animals into mammals, birds, reptiles with some knowledge).

    Temporal Relations: Understands sequences of historical or future events (e.g., distinguishes past, present, future fairly well; can talk about what happened last year vs. plans for next year). Uses timelines in simple ways (order of daily schedule or story events). Grasps the concept of longer time intervals (months, years) better by 8. Uses terms like “weekend”, “noon”, “midnight” correctly.

    Games with Rules: Shows strong interest in board games, sports, and computer games with complex rules, and can learn and remember these rules 
 Follows rules fairly and understands the rationale for rules. Can strategize in games (thinking a move or two ahead in checkers, planning resources in a video game). Also invents games with rules with peers. This reflects advanced cognitive skills in logic, memory, and social thinking.
