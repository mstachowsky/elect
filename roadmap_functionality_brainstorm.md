- Keep current functionality of asking questions, summarizing, and connecting to ELECT
- When a specific type of material is required for an activity, it should link to instructions
	that explain how to make the material. This can link to stuff that we created, or 
	something else. This way, it never seems like we are trying to push the parent to buy
	more things. 
- Track what it has seen previously for the child (ELECT domains and indicators)
- Giving a weekly summary of the child's learning 
- Giving curated suggestions for articles that parents can read (we will vet and maybe create the
	articles)
- Offering something like a mini baby sign course, teaching literacy etc. In general, we provide
	access to materials that can help parents learn, and interact
- A catalog of songs, music, and other resources
- Optional daily encouragement, as in duolingo but not so guilt trippy. More like affirmations that are personalized based on where they're at.
- A child profile that the parent can fill out to provide better context. Let parent get prompts to update the profile every week.
- A space for journaling milestones (like first tooth etc)
- A photo album for the parents
- Once they get the summary, we can ask them if they have a picture that they'd like to connect to the interaction, and let them upload them.
- Would be cool to offer a service where we take the learning stories and put them into a book or document so that they can order milestone books with pictures.
