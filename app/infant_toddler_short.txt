    INDICATOR: Sensory Exploration: Uses all senses to explore (e.g., prefers faces, tracks moving objects visually; shakes/bangs objects to hear sound; touches and mouths new items)     . Shows early sensory discrimination (turns toward familiar voices or smells, prefers certain textures or tastes)     .

    INDICATOR: Sensory-Motor Integration: Combines sensory input with actions in more complex ways (e.g., threads large beads on a pipe cleaner, does simple puzzles, coordinates hand-eye movements in play)
